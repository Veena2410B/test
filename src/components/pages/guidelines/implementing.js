      <h2>Implementing iHFeMS</h2>


                                <h3>Phase 1: Planning </h3>

<h6>Description</h6>
<p>The implementation of the iHFeMS requires careful planning to ensure that the
    implementation
    proceeds in comprehensive, cost-effective and timely ways. This involves a range of
    activities including
    establishment of the governance structure, budgeting, development of the
    implementation work plan,
    acquiring the iHFeMS software, readiness assessment and procurement of the required
    computing
    infrastructure.</p>

<h6>Objective</h6>
<p>To ensure adequate allocation of resources for successful iHFeMS implementation</p>

<h6>Scope</h6>
<p>All iHFeMS implementation activities in the health facility shall be subjected to a
    formal business
    planning process.</p>

<h6>Standard Guidelines</h6>
<br></br>

<h4>Establishing iHFeMS Governance</h4>
<p>The Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry Of Health, Community Development,
    Gender, Elderly
    and Children should be the Executive Sponsor of the iHFeMS implementation Project.
    The overall
    oversight of this initiative should be led by the National eHealth Steering
    Committee. Key project
    decisions and go-ahead approvals should be presented to the group.
    <br></br>The iHFeMS implementation should be led by the Head ICT at Ministry of
    Health, Community
    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children who is the current Champion of the project
    on behalf
    of the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children. The
    iHFeMS
    champion should be supported by the NeHSC to ensure the attainment of established
    objectives. The
    NeHSC should be supported by PO-RALG and Health facility iHFeMS implementation Lead,
    at the Health facility level as local supervisor. The Health facility level lead
    should be the primary link
    between the Health facility iHFeMS steering committee and NeHSC.
    <br></br>
    The overall oversight of the initiative at the Health facility level should be led
    by the Health facility
    iHFeMS Steering Committee. Key project decisions and go-ahead approvals should be
    presented to
    the group. The health facility in-charge shall be the chairperson for regional and
    district Health facility
    steering committees. Quarterly updates should be provided to National eHealth
    Steering Committee
    and the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Health, Community Development,
    Gender,
    Elderly and Children who is the Executive Sponsor of this initiative.

<h4>Budgeting</h4>
<p>Implementation of iHFeMS is a complex and challenging task. One obstacle to
    successful
    implementation can be the cost of converting to an electronic system when
    insufficient health care
    funding has been budgeted. It is essential that Health facility management and
    stakeholders involved in
    planning for iHFeMS implementation understand what funding is available and develop
    a timeframe
    for funding in conjunction with timetables for implementation.
    <br></br>The high cost of the software and computers means that the initial costs
    associated with the introduction
    of an iHFeMS are significant, both in terms of time and finance. However, the
    ongoing costs of
    running an iHFeMS as well as longer-term issues of maintenance and support are
    significant as well.</p>

                                <p>
                                    The implementation of the iHFeMS requires a well-established work plan. Therefore
                                    prior to
                                    commencing any activity, public Health facility must seek advice to Ministry of
                                    Health, Community
                                    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, eGovernment Agency (eGA), through PO-RALG
                                    on
                                    how to create the implementation work plan, and inform NeHSC at Ministry of Health,
                                    Community
                                    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children for approval. The work plan should
                                    explicitly state:

                                <ul>

                                </p>


                                <h4>Acquiring the iHFeMS</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Before implementing the iHFeMS in a health facility, Health facility management has
                                    to decide how
                                    to acquire the software for implementation. There are two possible options to obtain
                                    the right software
                                    for the Health facility. There are two types:

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Make and Build from scratch or customization of an existing software</b>
                                        Options for acquiring software at a facility are either in-house or outsourced
                                        development of
                                        the system or customization of existing software from a vendor or free and open
                                        source system
                                        market. The ministry or individual Health facility may consider using public
                                        private partnership
                                        (PPP) to acquire an iHFeMS through Build–operate–transfer (BOT)
                                        project-financing form.
                                        Customized software is an alternative, which will deliver value to a Health
                                        facility in providing
                                        software, which meets exact requirements as defined during analysis and
                                        specifications.
                                    </li>

                                    <li><b>Purchasing an existing software (Commercial-off-the-shelf software)</b>
                                        Another possible option to acquiring the software at a facility is to buy
                                        existing software from
                                        a vendor. This option is further divided into two alternatives.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Purchase software as a product in which a Health facility purchases and
                                                host it and
                                                managing itself while paying for annual license and maintenance fees.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Purchase software as service from a vendor who will be responsible for
                                                deployment,
                                                implementation and maintenance while a Health facility will be paying
                                                fees for the
                                                service provided by the vendor. The vendor will have sole ownership of
                                                the system.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    </li>

                                </ul>

                                There are several factors to consider when buying the software, however one of the main
                                factor is the
                                Total cost of ownership (TCO). The overall goal is to select technology that minimizes
                                TCO while
                                meeting minimum functional and operational standards. Other challenges which should be
                                critically
                                analysed in order avoid them from occurring include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dependency on the software vendor which sometimes leads to vendor lock in</li>
                                    <li>Incompatibilities from future modifications or upgrades of other systems</li>
                                    <li>Difficulty in integration with other systems</li>
                                    <li>Security issues</li>
                                </ul>

                                When evaluating the total cost of ownership (TCO), the following factors are to be
                                considered:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Acquisition Expenses</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Software licensing (for the Public Health facilities must opt for Open
                                            source software)
                                        </li>

                                    installation of the iHFeMS software. The configuration will include deployment of
                                    new forms, new
                                    reports and configuring the iHFeMS software for the specific Health facility. The
                                    installation will
                                    include server and software installation. This will depend on the deployment
                                    architecture adapted by
                                    the Ministry and the Health facility.

                                    and the system users. The software vendor must provide the following types of
                                    documentation:</p>

                                    System testing is an important step when rolling out any software. Before the system
                                    is put into
                                    production, the key stakeholders must perform acceptance testing to get the buy-off
                                    of the functionality.
                                    This should be done after every release of the system.

                                    will only occur if users like the system and commit to use it. Users need to
                                    understand what benefit
                                    the new system has for them, why they should use this new system, and how it is
                                    going to make their
                                    jobs easier. The Health facility management needs to understand how it is going to
                                    make them and
                                    their Health facility look better.

                                <p>Before the new system is put into production it should be piloted. After users have
                                    been trained,
                                    Health facility should run a limited trial-run of the iHFeMS in parallel to any
                                    previous system (paper
                                    or otherwise) to allow users to test their knowledge in using the system and make
                                    sure they full
                                    understand how to perform their job with the new system in place. At the end of the
                                    trial-run, the
                                    trial-run must be assessed to determine whether the Health facility is ready to go
                                    to production use of
                                    the new system. The assessment should be guided by a well define Trial-run to
                                    Production Readiness
                                    Assessment Tool (see Appendix D).

                                <b>Standard Guidelines</b>
                                <br></br>Changes to all information processing facilities, systems, software, or procedure should be strictly
                                controlled according to formal change management procedures. This section contains the Standard
                                guidelines.<br></br>

                                <ListGroup>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG1 Change Initiation: All system changes shall be initiated by filling in the change control form, which will be signed by the respective heads of department, and addressed to the ICT department.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG2 Change Authorization: Authorization for any changes, whether urgent or not, shall be given by the head of the ICT department if satisfied that the reason for the change is sound and that there is no adverse effect as a result of the change.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG3 Testing of changes: All testing shall be done from a test environment. No change will be applied to the live/production environment without having been tested in the test environment.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG4 Change approval: The concerned user departments shall check the system to see whether the results produced are as expected and a user acceptance testing (UAT) form shall be signed off.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG5 Change Scheduling: To minimize disruption to the normal working operations of the Health facility, no changes shall be effected in the system during normal working hours unless absolutely necessary. All changes will be scheduled during weekends, public holidays or after business working hours.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG6 Change Communication: All planned system changes shall be communicated in advance to the concerned parties to minimize on business disruption and inconveniences. For avoidance of doubt, no scheduled system change should be effected in the live iHFeMS during a busy business cycle.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG7 Change Recovery, Safety measures: Before effecting any change in the production environment, a backup on a clearly labelled storage media shall be taken and kept for good. In the event that the change made produces unexpected results, the backup taken before the change was effected has to be used to restore the system to the point before the change.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG8 Change Documentation and tracking: All system changes, whether approved or not shall be documented and filed. The documentation shall include a duly completed and signed off “change request form”, the test results and any other comments/documents used.

                                <p>
                                    This guideline and its supporting standards outline the requirements needed to protect the iHFeMS
                                    information through the enforcement of logging, monitoring and auditing processes
                                    <br></br>

                                    <b>Objective</b>

                                    To provide for the tracking of computing resource activity that will benefit the disclosure of unauthorized
                                    activity and to ensure the security status of the iHFeMS is known and understood by those who are
                                    responsible for maintaining that security.
                                    <br></br>

                                    <b>Scope</b>
                                    <br></br>The tracking of security related events and the data logs produced by the tracking mechanisms.

  <ListGroup.Item>SG1 Daily logs of all security events will be reviewed for unusual security events with further investigation of unusual events.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG2 Sufficient information for after-the-fact investigation of unauthorized activity must be logged. At a minimum the information in the tracking record associated with each event must include: User ID; Associated terminal, port, network address, communication device; Information or system accessed; Date and time of access; and Event Description.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG3 Health facility computing resources should be sufficiently monitored by a person responsible for ICT security to detect deviations from authorized use.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG4 Regular monitoring of the secure status of all Health facility electronic information must be undertaken, principally through the applications, platforms and infrastructure that support it.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG5 Monitoring of user activity on Health facility applications and the platforms supporting them must be undertaken on a regular basis, using the logs of user activity provided by those systems.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG6 Any actual or suspected breach of security or related incident will be reported, recorded and appropriate action taken to limit and remedy any impact on the security of the Health facility.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG7 The Health facility reserves the right to conduct all such monitoring activities on its systems as are necessary to preserve and measure the security of its information and assets.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG8 All employees, agents and contractors who make any use of Health facility systems must be informed of the Health facility’s right to monitor all such use and inspect any information entrusted to Health facility systems, whether personal or not.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG9 Monitoring of Health facility systems and access to logs and other information produced during monitoring must be restricted to employees specifically authorized to conduct such monitoring as part of their normal duties.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG10 Measures must be put in place to protect logging facilities and log information against tampering and unauthorized access.
</ListGroup.Item>
  <ListGroup.Item>SG11 The clocks of all relevant information systems (e.g., networking devices, servers, and PC’s) must be synchronized with an accurate time source for accuracy of timestamps on logs.
