        <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>Monitoring and evaluation is vital to ensure successful implementation and smooth
                                    operation of
                                    iHFeMS. As part of M & E, quality assurance exercise should run throughout the life
                                    cycle of the project
                                    especially during procurement of the iHFeMS and implementation process to ensure
                                    compliance with
                                    the national iHFeMS standards and guidelines. Furthermore, it is necessary to track
                                    and evaluate the
                                    implementation and functioning of the system in order to understand how well the
                                    implementation
                                    objectives have been met and the effect of iHFeMS in the day-to-day Health facility
                                    operations.</p>
